            Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer,
            [3] anti-colonial nationalist,[4] and political ethicist,
            [5] who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule, 
            [6] and in turn inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
            The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world. </p>
